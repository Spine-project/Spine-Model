AN EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION FOR HOW THE AUTOGENERATION OF `CONCEPT REFERENCE` BASED ON SPINEOPT TEMPLATE WORKS

References to other sections, e.g. [node](@ref) are handled like this.
Don't use the grave accents around the reference name, as it breaks the reference!
Grave accents in `Documenter.jl` refer to *docstrings* in the code instead of sections in the documentation.
