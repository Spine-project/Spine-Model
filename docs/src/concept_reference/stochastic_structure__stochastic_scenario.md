The [stochastic\_structure\_\_stochastic\_scenario](@ref) relationship defines which [stochastic\_scenario](@ref)s
are included in which [stochastic\_structure](@ref), as well as holds the [stochastic\_scenario\_end](@ref) and
[weight\_relative\_to\_parents](@ref) [Parameters](@ref) defining how the [stochastic\_structure](@ref) interacts
with the [Temporal Framework](@ref) and the [Objective function](@ref).
Along with [parent\_stochastic\_scenario\_\_child\_stochastic\_scenario](@ref),
this relationship is used to define the exact properties of each [stochastic\_structure](@ref),
which are then applied to the `objects` describing the modelled system according to the
[Structural relationship classes](@ref), like the [node\_\_stochastic\_structure](@ref) relationship.
