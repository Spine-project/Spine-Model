# NOTE: these `MissingItemHandler`s come into play whenever the database is missing some of the stuff
# SpineModel expects to find in there.
# The above can happen (i) during development, as we introduce new symbols for novel functionality, and
# (ii) in production, if the user 'accidentally' deletes something.
# I believe SpineModel needs this kind of safeguards to be robust.
# As things stabilize, we should see a correspondance between this
# and what we find in `spinedb_api.create_new_spine_database(for_spine_model=True)`
